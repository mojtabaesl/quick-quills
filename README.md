## Description

There is a wizard (letâ€™s call him Neville) who wants to buy some books for going to his
wizardry school before a new year of school starts. But Neville is quite forgetful and asked
his very good friend, the Head of the Department of Frontend Sorcery, to build him a
magical application which helps him make a Todo list of the books that he needs to buy, and
show the ones he has already bought from the Magical inventory of available books.
